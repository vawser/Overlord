Capture enemies and use them against their own to traverse the Shattered Lands and claim the Elden Throne.

# Combat System
Use Spirit Summon system for the enemy combat part. Detach the buddy stone requirement.

Player will deal no direct damage. 
Instead, weapons and spells will provide effects on hit that help out the spirit summon or weaken the enemy in some way.

Examples:
    Whip: boosts spirit summon damage, stacking per hit, but damages them too.
    Rousing Flames: heals spirit summons
    
In general, the player should still have autonomy within a fight and have to make decisions, but rather the focus is on surviving and helping out the spirit summon, rather than dealing damage.

# Capture System
Player uses a 'Pokeball' item to capture enemies.
 Display process with phantom shaders: when used the enemy will go white, and then flash 3 times based on the result:
  Catch: Green, Green, Green.
   Enemy will disappear in a puff of smoke, spirit summon item will be awarded.
   
  Near Miss: Green, Green, Red.
   Enemy will be easier to catch if capture is attempted again.
   
  Miss: Red, Red, Red.
  
 Capture chance is rolled in EMEVD, affected by:
    Enemy Type
    Enemy HP
    Player buff items
    
# Collection System
Collection is rewarded via a NPC, which will grant boss spirit summons based on collection progress.
